Computing the liquidation price for the isolated margin liquidation Price

1. IMR = 1 / Leverage

2. Initial Margin = Quantity * Entry Price * IMR

3. Liquidation Price ~= (Entry Price) - Initial Margin / Quantity = ( (Entry Price * Quantity) - Initial Margin ) / Quantity


For LONG:

		Liq. Price ~= Entry Price * (1 - 1 / Leverage)

		for conservative estimates, Liq. Price = Liq. Price * 1.005

For SHORT:

		Liq. Price ~= Entry Price * (1 + 1 / Leverage)

		for conservative estimates, Liq. Price = Liq. Price * 0.995


How much margin to add for a target liquidation price
